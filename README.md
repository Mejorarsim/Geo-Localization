# Geo-Localization Analysis of Tweets

This project analyzes the spatial distribution of tweets in London using a geo-tagged dataset. It implements a newsworthiness scoring mechanism to filter and examine tweets for their relevance. The project includes data preprocessing, grid-based spatial analysis, and the application of a newsworthiness scoring model to geo-tagged tweets.

## Overview

This project:
1. **Organizes tweets into 1km x 1km grids in London**.
2. **Develops a newsworthiness scoring method** based on high-quality, low-quality, and background tweets.
3. **Analyzes geo-tagged data using the newsworthiness scores** to assess the spatial distribution of newsworthy tweets.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises geo-tagged tweets from London, organized into several JSON files. It includes separate datasets for background tweets and for high and low-quality tweets used for the newsworthiness model.

- **Geo-tagged tweets:** `geoLondonSep2022_*.json`
- **Background tweets:** `bgQuality.json`
- **High-quality tweets:** `highQuality.json`
- **Low-quality tweets:** `lowQuality.json`

## Installation

To run this project, you need to install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**`requirements.txt`**:
```
nltk
geopandas
matplotlib
numpy
pandas
seaborn
shapely
```

## Usage

1. **Navigate to the data directory** containing the JSON files.
   ```bash
   %cd C:\Users\Simran\Desktop\neccchv\Simran\data\datajson
   ```

2. **Run the main script**:
   ```python
   python geo_localization_analysis.py
   ```

This script will:
- Combine and preprocess tweet data.
- Calculate tweet density in 1km x 1km grids.
- Apply newsworthiness scoring to the tweets.
- Visualize the results.

## Methods

### 1. Grid-Based Spatial Analysis

- **Compute Haversine Distance:** Calculate the distance between two geo-locations.
- **Grid Dimensions:** Determine the number of rows and columns for the grid covering the London area.
- **Tweet Distribution:** Count the number of tweets in each grid cell.

### 2. Newsworthiness Scoring

- **Data Preprocessing:** Tokenize and remove stopwords from tweets.
- **Term Frequency Calculation:** Compute term and document frequencies.
- **Likelihood Ratios:** Calculate likelihood ratios for terms based on term frequencies in high-quality, low-quality, and background tweets.
- **Scoring Tweets:** Assign newsworthiness scores to tweets based on term likelihood ratios.

### 3. Analysis and Visualization

- **Distribution Visualization:** Create histograms and heatmaps to visualize tweet distribution and newsworthiness scores.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Compute and visualize statistics of tweet distribution across grid cells.

## Results

### Grid-Based Analysis

- **Grid Dimensions:** 
  - Rows: {grid_row}
  - Columns: {grid_col}
  - Total Grids: {new_grid}

- **Tweet Distribution:**
  - Average Tweets per Grid Cell: {mean_tweet_in_a_cell}
  - Median Tweets per Grid Cell: {median_tweet_in_a_cell}
  - Maximum Tweets in a Grid Cell: {max_tweet_in_a_cell}
  - Minimum Tweets in a Grid Cell: {min_tweet_in_a_cell}

### Newsworthiness Analysis

- **Threshold Selection:** 
  - Chosen threshold for newsworthy tweets: {threshold}
- **Tweet Filtering:**
  - Number of High Newsworthy Tweets: {len(high_newsworthy_tweets)}
  - Number of Low Newsworthy Tweets: {len(low_newsworthy_tweets)}
  - Percentage of Removed Tweets: {removed_tweets_percentage:.2f}%

### Visualizations

- **Distribution of Tweets in Grid Cells:** 
  ![Tweets Distribution](figures/tweet_distribution_histogram.png)
- **Heatmap of Tweet Distribution:** 
  ![Heatmap](figures/tweet_distribution_heatmap.png)
- **Newsworthiness Score Distribution:** 
  ![Newsworthiness Scores](figures/newsworthiness_scores_distribution.png)

## Discussion

- **Spatial Distribution:** The tweet density varies significantly across London, with certain areas having a higher concentration of tweets.
- **Newsworthiness:** The newsworthiness score helps filter tweets, identifying those more relevant for analysis. The chosen threshold effectively separates high and low newsworthy tweets, with a reasonable balance between sensitivity and specificity.
